# Otto Frontend React Native (Expo)

Uses React Native and Expo to create an iOS and Android hybrid app

## Install

This root directory contains expo tools and is minimal.  
However, you should still run `npm install` in this root directory.

1. `npm install`
1. `npx expo-doctor`

## App Code

Most of your activity will be in the `src/` directory.
This is what was originally generated by `npx create-expo` with the default `blank` template.
You can use the other templates/examples as a reference when you build your app.
